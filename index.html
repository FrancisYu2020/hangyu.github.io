  <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
  <p>One of my favorite things is to resolve the Rubik's cube which helps to train both my reaction speed and my finger deftness. Apart from
  standard 3 by 3 by 3 Rubik's cube, I play various kinds of cubes and participated in <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/">WCA</a>
  (World Cube Association) competitions. The most exciting thing about this is that I can both improve my skills and more importantly make new
  friends in this process. My WCA homepage can be viewed <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016YUHA04">here</a>. My another
  hobby is to play table tennis, which is my favorite sport ever since I was in middle school, and I made it to represent my middle school to
  participate in the regional competition in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China. Also, I won many awards due to this hobby during my undergraduate period
   which is too many that I want to list them all. Other hobbies are but not limited to playing basketball, swimming, ice skating, singing, cooking, etc.</p>
  <h3>Social Experiences</h3>
  <p>During my undergraduate period, I was not only devoted to my course work, but also participated in many volunteer activities to devote my time to help
  others in need. Among those volunteer activities, my favorite one was to voluntarily teach how to resolve Rubik's cube every Friday afternoon
  in an elementary school to enrich those students' after class activities and skills. Despite I was the teacher, I actually also learned things
  such as how to organize students and how to vary my teaching strategy from students to students. One more thing is that I am sharing what I
  like to them and the Rubik's cube community might be promoted for this small thing.</p>
  <p>Other than volunteer experience, I also worked actively as the leader of <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B5%99%E6%B1%9F%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E9%AD%94%E6%9C%AF%E9%AD%94%E6%96%B9%E5%8D%8F%E4%BC%9A">the Magic Show and Magic Cube Club at Zhejiang University</a> and that was
  where the Outstanding Student Leaders Awards came. I hosted <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/FMCAsia2017">FMC Asia 2017</a>
  Hangzhou regional sub-court which is a competition that requires to use the fewest move solution to resolve a Rubik's cube in one hour for each scramble.
  And I also hosted <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/HangzhouSpring2018">WCA Hangzhou Spring 2018 Open</a> which had many
   different games and invited competitors from all over the world. I worked so actly in hosting these competitions because I love this hobby and
   hope to contribute my own effort to make a stronger community.
   The last experience is about table tennis. I also worked as a member in Table Tennis Club at Zhengjiang University and we also contribute our time to
   train students who registered table tennis class but had little experience in playing this sport. This program aims to help them pass the final exams
    of the table tennis class.</p>
