Hi there, my name's Hang Yu (pronounce as hung, and I even cannot find a good match for the last name), if the pronounciation annoys you, just call me Francis as my preferred name.

I am second year master student in Transportation Engineering at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and I am working with [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Dr. Yu Meng](https://yumeng5.github.io/) on Text Mining research. My research currently focuses on query-based abstractive summarization in text mining and I am also interested in other research topics that machine learning techniques can be a dominant.
